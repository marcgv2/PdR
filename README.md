# PdR - 4th of ESO Research Project

## About This Project

Welcome to the **RP** project! This repository contains the work I developed as part of my **4th of ESO (Educaci√≥n Secundaria Obligatoria)** research project. The aim of this project is to explore, learn, and showcase my skills and creativity. As the initial version of the project, it represents my research and efforts during this academic milestone.

### Future Expansion
Although this project was initially created for my research project, I plan to expand and improve it further in the future. Stay tuned for upcoming updates and features!
